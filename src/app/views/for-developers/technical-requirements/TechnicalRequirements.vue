        <p>
          Neon aims to support all popular modern browsers. However, based on Microsoft's recommendations, it must be
          pointed out the legacy Microsoft browsers
          <strong>IE11 and non Chromium Edge (pre v79)</strong> are specifically <strong>not supported</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, Neon strives to use semantic native HTML and fallbacks (where possible) so you may find
          most components work OK in legacy browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Neon is not focused on supporting legacy browsers pull requests for bug fixes are always welcome!

        <p>
          Currently Neon is built using VueJS 2.0 therefore the supported VueJS version is also 2.0. Neon is built using
          Typescript and classes so is positioned well for a quick transition to Vue 3.0 in the near future.
