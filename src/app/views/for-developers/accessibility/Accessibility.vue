        As much as possible Neon tries to use semantic HTML for creating components. This means most interactive
        components are implicitly accessible. Where semantic HTML is either not possible or unavailable Neon supports
        ARIA keyboard accessibility as well as the relevant ARIA roles and attributes on each component.

      <p>
        Please see individual component examples and APIs to see how they behave. Also the source code in GitHub can
        provide more about specific implementation details.
